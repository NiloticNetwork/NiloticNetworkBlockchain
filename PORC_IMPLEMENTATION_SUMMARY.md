## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build the project
./build.sh

```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Enable PoRC for a wallet
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/porc/enable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "wallet_address", "bandwidthLimit": 50}'

# Get statistics
curl http://localhost:5000/porc/stats

# Submit contribution
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/porc/submit_log \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "walletAddress": "wallet_address",
    "taskId": "task_123",
    "timestamp": 1234567890,
    "blockHeight": 1000,
    "bandwidthUsed": 100,
    "transactionsRelayed": 50,
    "uptimeSeconds": 300,
    "proofHash": "hash",
    "signature": "signature"
  }'
```

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### Database Queries

```sql
-- View wallet status
SELECT * FROM wallet_status WHERE is_enabled = 1;

-- View recent contributions
SELECT * FROM contributions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- View active pools
SELECT * FROM pools WHERE is_active = 1;

-- Calculate total rewards
SELECT SUM(total_rewards) FROM wallet_status;
```

### Log Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor PoRC activity
tail -f blockchain.log | grep -i porc

# Check system status
curl http://localhost:5000/porc/stats | jq
```
